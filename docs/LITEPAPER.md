# USTA Litepaper (short)

## TL;DR

USTA is a fixed-supply ERC-20 token on Ethereum created as a meme/community token for:
- tipping
- community activities
- small experiments and on-chain social coordination

Supply is fixed at **100,000,000,000 USTA**. Mint happens **once at deployment**; no further minting is possible.

Tagline: **“USTA bilir.”**

## What USTA is (and is not)

USTA is:
- a simple ERC-20 token with a hard supply cap
- a community meme brand (Turkish “usta” = master/craftsman)
- usable for tipping, bounties, community games, small experiments

USTA is not:
- a promise of profit
- an equity, bond, or claim on assets
- a guarantee of any utility beyond what the community builds

## Token parameters

- Network: Ethereum Mainnet
- Standard: ERC-20
- Name/Symbol: USTA / USTA
- Decimals: 18
- Total supply: 100,000,000,000 USTA (fixed)
- Minting: constructor mints MAX_SUPPLY once to the initial recipient

## Distribution

All supply was minted to the initial recipient at deployment.
Subsequent distribution occurs via normal on-chain transfers.

No public sale / ICO / IEO is claimed by this litepaper.

## Transparency

Canonical deployment info and verification links are maintained in:
- DEPLOYMENTS.md
- docs/OFFICIAL-LINKS.md

## Risks

- Market risk: price can be volatile or go to zero.
- Smart contract risk: while the code is simple and uses OpenZeppelin ERC-20, all software has risk.
- Phishing/impersonation: treat only links in OFFICIAL-LINKS.md as official.
